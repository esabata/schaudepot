# schaudepot

Schaudepot is a project out of the RefugeeHacks from Oct. 17, 2015, started in Mannheim (Germany).

#### Status: Planning

#### Description:
Schaudepot is a communication channel which connects local citizens, and engages them with social projects within their community. In an innovative way through monitors placed in points of interest (POI) - from bus stations, sights and stores - that announce events, projects, campaigns and news to the local community - by using the process of informal learning. 

Through a back-end, a group of collaborators can insert and edit contents that later on will be spread on a  monitors network previously placed in POI. The contents generated by the group of collaborators will be stored into a repository and then published. All contents will be approved by an Editor. 

The sources are being currently developed and is open for collaborators.
